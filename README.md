# Fedot time-series forecasting electricity case
The sources of the time-series forecasting real-world case that is published in Habr. 
It shows the advantages of FEDOT framework in the task. The link to the original post will be added soon.

The description of the jupyter notebooks:
- [case/fedot_ts_case.ipynb](https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/fedot_electro_ts_case/blob/main/case/fedot_ts_case.ipynb): main guide 'How to use FEDOT for timeseries forecasting'
- [case/ts_case_others.ipynb](https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/fedot_electro_ts_case/blob/main/case/ts_case_others.ipynb): comparison of frameworks for timeseries forecasting: FEDOT, AutoTS and pdarima
- [case/knn_model](https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/fedot_electro_ts_case/tree/main/case/knn_model): final ML pipeline with KNN model that was found with FEDOT and exported in json format
